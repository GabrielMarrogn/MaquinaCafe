The new building of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) has 3 floors. At certain times of the year, SBC employees drink a lot of coffee. Because of this, the president of SBC has decided to give the employees a new espresso machine. This machine is to be installed on one of the 3 floors, but the installation must be done in such a way that people do not waste too much time going up and down stairs.

Each employee of the SBC drinks 1 espresso a day. They have to go from the floor where they work to the floor where the machine is and back to their workstation. Every employee takes 1 minute to go up or down one floor. Since the SBC cares a lot about efficiency, she wants to position the machine in a way that minimizes the total time spent going up and down stairs.

Your task is to help management position the machine so that the total time spent by employees going up and down stairs is minimized.
